# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

The blog is built with Hugo and the Hyde theme. Core configuration lives in `hugo.yaml`. Long-form content resides in `content/posts`, organized as `year/month/slug/index.md` bundles that keep related images side-by-side. Custom layout overrides and partials are under `layouts/`, while the upstream theme remains in `themes/hyde/`—avoid editing theme files unless upstream changes are being vendored. Site-wide styling tweaks belong in `assets/css/custom.css`, which Hugo pipes into the final bundle. Static assets such as favicons, the Decap CMS app (`static/admin/`), and shared images stay in `static/`. The published HTML generated by `hugo` lands in `public/` and should not be checked in manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Run `hugo` to produce the static site in `public/`. Use `hugo server -D --buildDrafts --disableFastRender` for a live-reloading preview that includes drafts. Execute `hugo --minify` before deploying to ensure the pipeline succeeds with the same optimizations used in production.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Front matter is YAML; keep `date` fields in ISO-8601 with timezone offsets and reuse the bilingual `categories` values defined in the CMS. Slugs should match the directory name and stay URL-safe (Hugo handles UTF-8). Go template files in `layouts/` prefer two-space indentation and whitespace-trimming `{{- ... -}}` delimiters. Extend styling via `assets/css/custom.css` using two-space indents and grouping related rules; avoid editing `themes/hyde` CSS directly.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no dedicated test suite, so treat `hugo` as the primary check. Run `hugo --printPathWarnings --printI18nWarnings` to catch missing resources or translation issues, and verify pages manually at `http://localhost:1313`. When modifying the CMS schema, confirm that Decap loads by visiting `/admin/` locally or on the preview environment.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commit messages follow an imperative, sentence-style pattern such as “Fix image syntax in blog post …”. Scope each commit to one logical change (content, layout, or assets). Pull requests should summarize the change, note any new content bundles or config edits, and include screenshots for layout adjustments. Mention the Hugo commands you ran and link related issues or CMS entries when available.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Analytics and CMS endpoints are configured in `hugo.yaml` and `static/admin/config.yml`; keep URLs editable via params and avoid hard-coding credentials. Review generated `public/robots.txt` after config changes to ensure crawl directives remain accurate.
